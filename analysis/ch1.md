### Key Points

- War must be examined with the greatest care.
- If you are in line with your superiors, you can go to your death without misgivings.
- All commanders are familiar with the five criteria.
- The commander who masters the five criteria will take the victory.
- The commander who does not master the five criteria will not prevail.

### Methodologies

- To gauge the outcome of war we must appraise the situation on the basis of five criteria:
  1. The way (tao).
  2. Climate.
  3. Terrain.
  4. Command.
  5. Regulation.
- To compare the two sides, we must assess their relative strengths.
- Questions to assess the two sides:
  - Which ruler has the way (tao)?
  - Which commander has the greater ability?
  - Which side has the advantages of climate and terrain?
  - Which army follows regulations and obeys orders more strictly?
  - Which army has superior strength?
  - Whose officers and men are better trained?
  - Which side is more strict and impartial in meting out rewards and punishments?
- Knowing the answers to these questions will determine who will win and who will lose.
- Dispatching troops into battle will mean certain victory if you heed the assessments.
- If a commander does heed the assessments, keep him.
- Dispatching troops into battle will mean certain defeat if you do not heed the assessments.
- If a commander does not heed the assessments, dismiss him.
- The calculations for victory are made by military strategists.
- The calculations for victory cannot be settled in advance.
- The outcome of the war becomes apparent by scoring points in the temple rehearsal of the battle.
- The side that scores many points will win the war beforehand.
- The side that scores few points will lose the war beforehand.
- The side that scores no points at all will not win the war.
- The outcome of the war becomes apparent by examining the points scored.

### Open Questions

- What is the difference between war and warfare?
- What means "mastering" the five criteria?
